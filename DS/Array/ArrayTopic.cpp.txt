Count minimum steps to get the given desired array April 25, 2016
	Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero. 
	We can perform following operations on the array. Incremental operations:
	Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
	Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array. 
	We are given desired array target[] containing n elements

Count pairs with given sum April 16, 2016
	Given an array of integers, and a number ‘sum’, find the number of pairs of integers in the 
	array whose sum is equal to sum. 
	//Examples Input : arr[] = {1, 5, 7, -1}, sum = 6 Output : 2 Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5) and (7, -1) 

Find lost element from a duplicated array 
	Given two arrays which are duplicates of each other except one element, 
	that is one element from one of the array is missing, we need to find that missing element. 
	//Examples: Input: arr1[] = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} arr2[] = {4, 5, 7, 9} Output: 1 1 is missing from second array. 
	
Find minimum difference between any two elements
	Given an unsorted array, find the minimum difference between any pair in given array.
	//Examples : Input : {1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25}; Output : 1 Minimum difference is between 18 and 19 
	//Input : {30, 5, 20, 9}; Output : 4 Minimum difference is between 5 and 9 	
Rearrange an array in maximum minimum form
	Given a sorted array of positive integers, rearrange the array alternately 
	i.e first element should be maximum value, second minimum value, third second max, 
	fourth second min and so on. 
	//Examples: Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
	//Output : arr[] = {7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4} 
	
Count Strictly Increasing Subarrays February 11, 2016
	Given an array of integers, count number of subarrays (of size more than one) 
	that are strictly increasing. Expected Time Complexity : O(n) Expected Extra Space: O(1)
	//Examples: Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 3} Output: 1 There is only one subarray {1, 4} 
	//Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4} Output: 6 There are 6

Subarray/Substring vs Subsequence and Programs to Generate them February 5, 2016
	Subarray/Substring A subbarray is a contiguous part of array. An array that is inside another array. 
	For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], There are 10 non-empty sub-arrays. 
	The subbarays are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4). 
	In general, for an array/string of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2… Read More »

Form minimum number from given sequence February 2, 2016
	Given a pattern containing only I’s and D’s. I for increasing and D for decreasing. 
	Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number following that pattern. 
	Digits from 1-9 and digits can’t repeat. Examples: Input: D Output: 21 
	//Input: I Output: 12 Input: DD Output: 321 Input: II Output: 123 Input:

Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space January 16, 2016
	We are given two sorted array. We need to merge these two arrays such that the initial numbers 
	(after complete sorting) are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. 
	Extra space allowed in O(1). 
	//Example: Input: ar1[] = {1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20}; ar2[] = {2, 3, 8
	
Longest Span with same Sum in two Binary arrays December 25, 2015
	Given two binary arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of same size n. 
	Find length of the longest common span (i, j) where j >= i such that arr1[i] + arr1[i+1] + …. + arr1[j]
	 = arr2[i] + arr2[i+1] + …. + arr2[j]. 
	 Expected time complexity is T(n). 
	 //Examples: Input: arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 0, 0
 
Count Inversions of size three in a give array December 21, 2015
	Given an array arr[] of size n. Three elements arr[i], arr[j] and arr[k]
